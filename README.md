# 2dGameEngine

This engine is based on [Gustavo Pezzi's course](https://www.udemy.com/course/cpp-2d-game-engine/).

To run it all you have to do is download it. install SDL2 libraries, build it with `make` and run it with `make run`.

**NOTES:**

- I was creating an editor for this, yet I decided to build a new version of the engine which can run on mobile devices. You check the project using [this link](https://github.com/santyarellano/CrossEngine).
- I also wrote a more detailed guide on how to get things running. It's in the project described in the line above.
